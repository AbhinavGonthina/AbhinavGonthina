## 🌱 What I’m Into  
- Using code to **solve real problems** and not just classroom exercises — I like when something I build ends up being useful for others.  
- Shipping projects that **people actually use**, whether it’s a startup demo, a hackathon prototype, or a tool for my club.  
- Teaching & mentoring — I enjoy breaking down tough CS concepts into simpler pieces, whether it’s through recitations, office hours, or just helping a friend debug.
